hyperTree project.
This project aims to embed the tree structure of a particles' shower into the hyperbolic space, in particular the Poincare' disk. This would enhance the clustering algorithms.

Features:
- hyperEmbedding, takes a full event and projects it into the Poincare' disk
- geNN, graph embedding neural network. With a supervised learning method, it projects leaves particles into the Poincare' disk, using what has been learnt from the hyperEmbedding
